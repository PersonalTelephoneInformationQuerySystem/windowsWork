# windowsWork
The purpose of this project is to complete the data structure training. 
It uses a red-black tree as the body.
The development tools I use are QT creator 5.12.0.
The development environment I use is Windows 10 Professional OS.
I've already passed a preliminary test of it on my personal computer.
It has the following problems:
  1. Input instabilityï¼Œ
  2. Other unknown errors affecting operation and performance.
I hope everyone on github can give me some advice.
                                    Thanks.
